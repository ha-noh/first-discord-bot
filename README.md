# ABOUT THIS HERE BOT
This is all a test. What makes a Discord bot tick?
# HOW TO USE YOUR OWN VERSION OF THIS HERE BOT
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications using the account you would like the bot to function under, and create an application.
2. From the application page, go to Settings>Bot to create a bot from your new application.
3. Download/clone this repository, and create a file named `.env` in the main directory. Have its contents be `BOT_TOKEN = (your bot token)`; this bot token can be found on the same page where you created your bot.
4. To run this bot locally, go to this repository in a CLI and use the command `node bot.js` to spin up your new bot. Presumably you have node.js installed.
