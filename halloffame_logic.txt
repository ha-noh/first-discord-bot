Goal: Have the bot repost posts from an input channel to an output channel if a number of unique users react to it - 
	it is essentially an automated hall of fame.

Upon reaction to a Post in the designated input Channel: 

Check if the reaction
(1) occcured in the correct channel,
(2) is an image/video post (maybe allow text if it's in a quote?)

Check data Structure for the Post being reacted to, add an entry if it doesn't exist
(1) if the Post is flagged, then it has already been reposted - return
(2) update the reaction user List -
	(a) if it's >= the Threshold, repost it and flag the original Post as done
	(b) if the number of unique users in the List are less than the Threshold, return

Repost
(1) Take the url and send a new message in the designated output channel
(2) Include the original poster's username
(3) Maybe include some data so that the bot can reconstruct the list of flagged posts even after a restart
(4) It could be fun to have the bot react to the repost with number emojis == 
	the number of unique reactors to the original post
